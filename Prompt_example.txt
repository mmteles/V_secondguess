Generate [specific function/algorithm] in [programming language] suitable for [environment/version].  
Requirements:  
- [1. Exact functional description]  
- [2. Performance/security constraints]  
- [3. Edge cases and error handling]  
Include clear comments explaining the code logic. Provide a step-by-step explanation of your approach.  
If uncertain, do not guess; indicate limitations.

5-Step Prompt Template for Error-Free Code Generation
	1.	Specify Role and GoalDefine the AI’s role and precisely what coding task you want.Example: “You are an expert Python developer. Generate a function to calculate the factorial of a number.”
	2.	Provide Context and RequirementsInclude the programming language, version, environment, and detailed functional requirements.Example: “Use Python 3.10. The function should handle input validation and return an error for negative values.”
	3.	Add Constraints and Edge CasesMention performance targets, security considerations, error handling, and tricky edge cases.Example: “Ensure the function is optimized for inputs up to 1000 and handles large integer overflow gracefully.”
	4.	Request Clear, Commented Code with ExplanationAsk for well-documented code with line-by-line comments and a follow-up explanation of logic.Example: “Include comments explaining each step and provide a brief summary of how the function works.”
	5.	Set Verification and Safety InstructionsInstruct the AI to avoid guessing when uncertain and request a note on any assumptions or limitations.Example: “If unsure, state the assumptions made or indicate which parts need human review before use.”


You are an expert Python developer.

Generate a function in Python 3.10 that calculates the factorial of a number. Requirements:
- Validate input to accept only non-negative integers.
- Return a descriptive error message for invalid inputs.
- Optimize for performance for inputs up to 1000.
- Include checks to prevent integer overflow and handle edge cases correctly.

Please write clean, well-commented code explaining each step. After the code, provide a summary explaining how the function works step-by-step.

If uncertain about any part, clearly state the assumptions or limitations instead of guessing.


Prompted:
You are an expert and AI, AI agents, and MCP supporting the design of a spec for developing a AI based agent to create and generate SOPs.

The product will be a conversational tool that, after start, receives a task regarding a workflow or a process(For example: automate a given workflow, improve the efficiency of a given process, prepare material for onboarding and training staff on a given procedure, etc).

When the user is talking, his voice will be transcripted for validation and accuracy. 

Added:
for requirement 1 add that the SOP_Agent will offer to the user the option to read the text generated.

Plus, it will always add the sentence: "That's all or there is something missing?"

Iterate in this process while the user keeps adding new information to the summary. If he keeps adding, after 5 times, ask if he wants more time to review and elaborate on their description or if he wants to continue answering.

Added:
In requirements 3:

Generate business modeling charts, like event diagrams, flowcharts, and any other chart that will visually support the content of the SOP.
